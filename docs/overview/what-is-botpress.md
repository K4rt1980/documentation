## What Is Botpress?

:::info Quick Definition
Botpress is an open-source platform for developers to build high-quality digital assistants.
:::

At its core, Botpress is a tool to simplify building chatbots for developers. The platform puts together the boilerplate code and infrastructure you need to get a chatbot up and running and gives a complete dev-friendly platform that ships with all the tools you need to build, deploy, and manage production-grade chatbots in record time. The platform includes:

- Built-in [Natural Language Processing](/docs/building-chatbots/language-understanding/supported-languages) tasks such as [intent classification](/docs/building-chatbots/language-understanding/intents/slots), [spell checking](/docs/building-chatbots/language-understanding/intents/spell-checking), [entity extraction](/docs/building-chatbots/language-understanding/entities/system-entities), and many others;
- A visual [Conversation Studio](/docs/overview/quickstart/conversation-studio) to design multi-turn conversations and workflows;
- An [emulator](/docs/building-chatbots/testing-&-debugging/emulator) & a [debugger](/docs/building-chatbots/testing-&-debugging/debugger) to simulate conversations and debug your chatbot;
- Support for popular messaging channels like [Slack](/docs/messaging-channels/direct-integrations/slack), [Telegram](/docs/messaging-channels/direct-integrations/telegram), [Microsoft Teams](/docs/messaging-channels/direct-integrations/microsoft-teams), [Facebook Messenger](/docs/messaging-channels/direct-integrations/facebook-messenger), and an [embeddable web chat](/docs/messaging-channels/botpress-webchat/website-embedding/website-interactions);
- An SDK and Code Editor to extend the capabilities;
- [Post-deployment](/docs/going-to-production/deploy/linux) tools like [analytics](/docs/chatbot-management/chatbot-analytics/built-in-analytics), [human handoff](/docs/chatbot-management/agent-handover/human-in-the-loop/hitlnext), and more...

## With Botpress, You Can...

**Automate Workflows**: Do you want to automate your chatbot? Gather the potential user information you need. And... there you go!

**Support your customer 24/7**: You know how it works. If there's nobody when your user needs help, they will find a new place to do (almost) the same. Having a chatbot that answers your user's questions while you're asleep... What a dream!

**Allow employees to self-serve**: Self-serve is something people _want_. Let's look at a classic example: resetting your password. Sometimes, you have to ask your system administrator or any IT person reachable (and maybe this person is sleeping too) because you have been logged out of your email. The truth is you could just ask in Slack for a password reset and do it yourself.

**Create a conversational interface for an application**: Some applications are better delivered with a GUI, but in other cases, a conversational interface is simply a better option. Itâ€™s just natural for someone to ask in plain English rather than browsing an interface. For example, they ask:

:::note Example
Hey, I am looking for [insert what they want here].
:::

That means that they want help! And Botpress is precisely what they need.
