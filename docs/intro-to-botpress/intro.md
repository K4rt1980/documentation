## What Is Botpress?

:::info Short and Sweet Definition

Botpress is an open-source platform for developers to build high-quality digital assistants.

:::

At its core, Botpress is a tool to simplify the process of building chatbots for developers. The platform puts together the boilerplate code and infrastructure you need to get a chatbot up and running and gives a complete dev-friendly platform that ships with all the tools you need to build, deploy, and manage production-grade chatbots in record time. The platform includes:

- Built-in [Natural Language Processing](/docs/nlu/nlu-intro) tasks such as [intent recognition](/docs/nlu/intent-classification), [spell checking](/docs/nlu/spell-checking), [entity extraction](/docs/nlu/entity-extraction), and [slot tagging](/docs/nlu/slot-tagging), and many others;
- A visual [Conversation Studio](/docs/conversation-studio/conversation-studio-intro) to design multi-turn conversations and workflows;
- An [emulator](/docs/conversation-studio/tutorials/emulator) & a [debugger](/docs/intro-to-botpress/tutorials/debug) to simulate conversations and debug your chatbot;
- Support for popular messaging channels like [Slack](/docs/messaging/slack), [Telegram](/docs/messaging/telegram), [Microsoft Teams](/docs/messaging/microsoft-teams), [Facebook Messenger](/docs/messaging/facebook-messenger), and an [embeddable web chat](/docs/messaging/botpress-webchat);
- An SDK and [Code Editor](/docs/conversation-studio/code-editor/actions) to extend the capabilities;
- Post-deployment tools like [analytics](/docs/conversation-studio/analytics-overview) dashboards, [human handoff](/docs/conversation-studio/hitl-next-overview), and more...

## Why Botpress (VS Our Competition)?

Botpress has many advantages over other platforms and frameworks:

- It is cloud-agnostic; therefore, you can run it on the cloud platform or the on-premise infrastructure of your choice, giving you full control over your data privacy.
- The core of Botpress is an open-source chatbot software with thousands of GitHub contributors and stargazers, and a thriving community forum.
- The platform offers a solid developer experience by being remarkably flexible, easy to use, and fast. We offer support for multiple languages, including French, Arabic, Spanish, and over 100 more languages.
- No vendor lock-in.
- Most importantly, our platform has proven to deliver a better conversational experience to end-users.

## With Botpress, You Can...

**Automate Workflows**: You want to automate your chatbot? Gather the potential user information you need. And... this is it!

**Support your customer 24/7**: You know how it works. If there's nobody at the time your user needs help, they will go find a new place to do (almost) exactly the same. Having a chatbot that answer your user's questions while you're asleep... What a dream!

**Allow employees to self-serve**: Self-serve is something people _want_. Let's look at a classic example: resetting your password. Sometimes, you have to ask your system administrator or any IT person reachable (and maybe this person is sleeping too) because you have been logged out of your email. The truth is you could just ask in Slack for a password reset and do it yourself.

**Create a conversational interface for an application**: Some applications are better delivered with a GUI, but in other cases, a conversational interface is simply a better option. Itâ€™s just really natural for someone to ask in plain English rather than browsing an interface. For example, they ask:

> Hey, I am looking for [insert what they want here].

That means that they want help! And Botpress is exactly what they need.
