To show an image with an optional title in the chat window, you can use the _Image_ content element. Supported image formats are .tiff, .jpg, .png, .jpeg, .gif, .bmp, .tif. When loading an image from a variable url, you may need to use triple braces to unescape the url e.g.,, ```{{{temp.imageUrl}}}```.
