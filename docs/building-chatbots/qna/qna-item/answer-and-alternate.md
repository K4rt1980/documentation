title: Answer and Alternate
---

--------------------

When you use the Q&A section, you can have a question (or more, which is recommended) and one answer or you can create alternate answers. Those are randomly sent to the users. This makes the chatbot more "human". 

Alternate answers have a different structure, but their meaning stays the same.


1. In the [Conversation Studio](/overview/quickstart/conversation-studio), click the **Q&A** tab.
1. If not done yet, [create a question](/building-chatbots/qna/qna-item/question-variations).
1. Under **Answer**, type the basic answer to the question in the box.
1. Click **+ Add Answer Alternatives**.
1. Type as many alternatives you need.
:::tip Best Practice
Press `enter` after typing your answer. It quickly adds a new alternative.

1. You might have to train your chatbot again.
1. Try it with the **[Emulator](/building-chatbots/testing-&-debugging/emulator)**.

The number of answers is not important. It could be 1 or 10, or even more, it won't make a difference for the Language Understanding. However, for the [questions](/building-chatbots/qna/qna-item/question-variations), you might want to add different utterrances to teach your chatbot that it doesn't have to precisely match the question asked.

**Example:**

When a user ask for the opening hours, you could add those alternate answers:

- `Monday to Friday from 8AM to 5PM.`
- `We are opened from Monday to Friday at 8AM until 5PM.`
- `Our opening hours are from 8AM to 5PM on weekdays. `
- `You can reach us from 8AM to 5PM every day of the week.`
- `The store opens at 8AM and closes at 5PM every weekday.`
- `We're opened from 8AM to 5PM on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. We're closed on the weekends.`
