---------------

Most chatbot conversations will eventually have a question with hardcoded choices as answers. In addition to just letting you click a button, the choice skill adds a few checks and transitions to the process.

When freely typed responses are not disabled, the choice skill allows you to add answers which the user might type directly. This way, the chatbot understands and classifies other responses besides the button click, adding a good measure of flexibility.

:::note
You can also disable the freely typed response.

The choice skill also allows you to let the user have another chance at answering the question asked. When the user fails to perceive that a button response is required, the chatbot prompts the user to choose from the supplied choices.

:::tip
If the chatbot doesn't understand a user's answer, make it react by guiding the user on how to respond to the question before asking the question again.

The choice skill also offers an option to transition to a different node when the user repeatedly fails to answer a question.
