The file content type is currently only supported by channel-vonage. It allows you to upload a pdf file which the user can download from the chat. In addition, you can add an optional title which will appear as a message under the file. When loading a file from a variable url, you may need to use triple braces to unescape the url i.e., ```{{{temp.fileUrl}}}```.
