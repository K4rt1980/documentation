The first time you open Botpress, it might be overwhelming. There are so many things everywhere. Don't worry we will go through every tab that you can find on the left sidebar to help you.

![Admin](admin.png)

The Admin is where you manage and configure everything related to your Botpress Server installation. It is the one-stop-shop for all functionalities that affect all the chatbots on a Botpress Server instance.

**Features:**
- Creating new chatbots.
- Managing your Botpress Enterprise license and sync with version control.
- Updating your profile and your Botpress Account.
- Unpacking and activating modules.

To open the Admin Dashboard, visit [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) (or the 3001, 3002, 3003...) in your favourite web browser. After that, register the main admin account to start using Botpress.
